# nodeAPI #

A small project to introduce myself to node and it's API usage. I've done a lot
of API projects in python and java, so I'm excited to try nodeJS.

## Dependencies ##
- NodeJS  >=  v15.1.0
- NPM     >=  7.0.8
- mongoDB setup remotely through Atlas

## Setup ##
1. Load a config file name "config.json" with your mongo creds:
  `{
    "username": <un>,
    "password": <pw>,
    "dbname": <db_name>
  }`

2. npm install
3. npm start

***Achievements:***
- Write a functioning API, begin with a simple API service (GET, POST)
- Linked up with mongoDB to process BASIC login
- Loadable webpage on locally hosted app

***GOALS:***
- Improving with a simple API service (PUT, DELETE)
- Implementing a GraphQL solution down the line
- Lightweight native JS and maybe a Vue/Angular library down the road
